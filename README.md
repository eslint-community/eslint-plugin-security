# eslint-plugin-security

ESLint rules for Node Security

This project will help identify potential security hotspots, but finds a lot of false positives which need triage by a human.

### Installation

`npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-security`

### Usage

Add the following to your `.eslintrc` file:

```js
"plugins": [
  "security"
]
```


## Developer guide

- Use [GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
- Conventions:
 - We use our [custom ESLint setup](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-config-nodesecurity).
 - Please implement a test for each new rule and use this command to be sure the new code respects the style guide and the tests keep passing:
 ```sh
 npm run-script cont-int
 ```

### Tests
```sh
npm test
```

### Rules

#### `detect-unsafe-regex`

Locates potentially unsafe regular expressions, which may take a very long time to run, blocking the event loop.

#### `detect-buffer-noassert`

Detects calls to [`buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) with `noAssert` flag set

From the Node.js API docs: "Setting `noAssert` to true skips validation of the `offset`. This allows the `offset` to be beyond the end of the `Buffer`."

#### `detect-child-process`

Detects instances of [`child_process`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html) & non-literal [`exec()`](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback)

#### `detect-disable-mustache-escape`

Detects `object.escapeMarkup = false`, which can be used with some template engines to disable escaping of HTML entities. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

#### `detect-eval-with-expression`

Detects `eval(variable)` which can allow an attacker to run arbitary code inside your process.

#### `detect-no-csrf-before-method-override`

Detects Express `csrf` middleware setup before `method-override` middleware. This can allow `GET` requests (which are not checked by `csrf`) to turn into `POST` requests later.

#### `detect-non-literal-fs-filename`

Detects variable in filename argument of `fs` calls, which might allow an attacker to access anything on your system.

More information: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Path_Traversal

#### `detect-non-literal-regexp`

Detects `RegExp(variable)`, which might allow an attacker to DOS your server with a long-running regular expression.

More information: https://blog.liftsecurity.io/2014/11/03/regular-expression-dos-and-node.js

#### `detect-non-literal-require`

Detects `require(variable)`, which might allow an attacker to load and run arbitrary code, or access arbitrary files on disk.

#### `detect-object-injection`

Detects `variable[key]` as a left- or right-hand assignment operand.

More information: https://blog.liftsecurity.io/2015/01/14/the-dangers-of-square-bracket-notation/

#### `detect-possible-timing-attacks`

Detects insecure comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `!==` and `===`), which check input sequentially.

More information: https://snyk.io/blog/node-js-timing-attack-ccc-ctf/

#### `detect-pseudoRandomBytes`

Detects if `pseudoRandomBytes()` is in use, which might not give you the randomness you need and expect.
